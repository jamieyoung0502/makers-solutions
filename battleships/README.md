# Battleships Project

Design and test-drive a terminal-based Battleships game.

## Getting Started

How to get started:

```shell
; pipenv install # To install dependencies

; pipenv run pytest # All tests should pass
; pipenv run pytest --cov lib # To see test coverage too

; pipenv run python play.py
# This will give you a few prompts and show you a board.
```

ðŸ’¡ Notes

- **Association**: shows that one class uses another class or has some kind of relationship with it. This relationship can be one-way or two-way.
- **Direct Association**: where one class uses another class directly but the objects can exist independently, for example, a car and a passenger.
- **Aggregation**: where one class contains another class as a part of it. In other words, it's a "has-a" relationship. For example, a library has a book. The book is part of the library, but it can also exist on its own. Here the associated objects are a crucial part of the containing object.
- **Composition**: the contained object cannot exist without the container. The container "owns" the contained object. For example, a board is composed of tiles. If the board is destroyed, the tiles are destroyed as well.
- **Inheritance**: a mechanism that allows one class to inherit properties and behaviour from another class. The class that is being inherited from is called the superclass or parent class, and the class that inherits from it is called the subclass or child class.
